TopoJSON worldmaps with modified country borders

Maps are originally based on the the low-res world maps included in the markmarkoh/datamaps project:
https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/blob/master/src/js/data/world.json
Datamaps maps are themselves based on 'shapefiles produced by "Natural Earth": http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/

How I produced the modified maps:
- Original File type: GeoJSON (from datamaps repository)
- Manually modified the topology via the Application QGIS (having "topological editing" enabled)
- saved file as GeoJSON
- converted file to TopoJSON via the command line tool geo2topo (Mike Bostock): https://github.com/topojson/topojson/blob/master/README.md

## Topological adaptations:
### Border Marocco / Western Sahara
In the original map data (produced by Natural Earth) the territory of Marocco also includes the western part of the disputed territory Western Sahara (from the Atlantic border to the border wall ("berm")). The territory of Western Sahara begins east of the berm.
In the new map the territory of Western Sahara includes the territory to the west of the berm.
The border of Marocco and Western Sahara is being formed by a circle of latitude at 27.6Â°N.
I've derived this number from the MINURSO deployment map published by the United Nations as of February 2009 (http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/dpko/minurso.pdf)
